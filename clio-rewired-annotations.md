connected ideas:  ;It took me a moment to absorb this paragraph. Of the digital/DH events I've attended , more than half of the presenters have been women. Particularly in Canada. And, you know... it might even be about 65%. 

When I think about the disciplines that the presenters came from, though, the gender divide gets a lot more jagged. Eg., if an event is computer- or code-focused, there are more male presenters. Interestingly, though, the history ones I've attended have been mainly women-led. But most of the history ones have been from well-funded institutions in the States and the sort of work the researchers were doing would, traditionally, have been categorised as "soft" (qualitative, interview-based, trauma-focused, etc.) research. 

It seems as though the gender division remains despite changes in the skills required. Eg, computer/coding/data would traditionally have been "male". But now those skills, if performed in pursuit of human-/healing-/justice-/pedagogy-based research, don't seem to "count" - the style of research or purpose of activity overrides. 

Same pattern as mentioned in "[Show Your Work](https://data-feminism.mitpress.mit.edu/pub/0vgzaln4/release/3)"? [Women are scanning and OCRing](https://hypothes.is/a/6YlEfhSfEeyyjHuH6CZaTA) (tech-related work) but are underpaid "admin workers" not credited as having tech skills.

If anyone was up for turning this amorphous musing into an actual point, that would be cool. ;)

connected ideas:  ;Relates to the earlier comment of who is doing the work vs. who has the time to write about it. I also wonder if the ways that academy accepts as legit for people writing about what they're doing factors in to the representation. Eg., I know a number of women who blog or write guest pieces more than they formally publish. Hmm.

connected ideas:  ;This is a concept I got to learn about with Graham Smart, in the context of STEM publishing. I don't know enough about it to really comment meaningfully, but this practice seems to have some pretty cool decolonizing/gender-divide-minimizing potentials. I'd be interested to hear about why *Epoiesen* decided to go this way and what results have been observed.

connected ideas:  ;I'm not very good at this THOMAS thing just yet. I'm used to working in the IMRAD format - which is dry and summary-based - so this is pushing me to think in a way I'm not quite sure how to pull off just yet. Sorry for the meh quality of the page-level annotations so far! I'll learn from y'all.
