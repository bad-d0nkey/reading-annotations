# Spatial Storytelling
URL: http://www.playthepast.org/?p=2967

"Where", for me, is defined by the intersection of space, place, time, and person. I'm interested in studying the perspective of space/place/time, but the only place I've seen it as a discrete area of study is in anthropology. But, as [Dening said](https://www-jstor-org.proxy.library.carleton.ca/stable/2677952?seq=1#metadata_info_tab_contents), I don't necessarily want to enter into the discourses of anthropology. I'm a history interloper - it's not been my primary field of study. Anyone have any thoughts on this in terms of doing history?

connected ideas:  ;This might seem a silly question, but... how is this different from everyday life? I mean, I recognise that we are aware when we enter a space and time has passed - we were here yesterday, and now we're here today. But it seems the same dynamic. 

I don't think I'm articulating the half-concept that is starting to form here. Lol.

> It is a static place that is simply represented different ways. To the player however, that representation communicates the illusion of temporal movement because of its represented change[^1]

I'm not trying to be rude - I'm actually curious and would love folks who know better than I to chime in here. :)

connected ideas:  ;This article examines the relationship of space and time in video games via mapping the concepts onto our relationship with time in real life and in experiencing, in present times, a sense of history when in historical places. 

Places, Bembeneck suggests, are static. Our relationships with them are defined and shaded by our sense of the temporal. 

To be honest, I have a weird perception of time and struggled a bit with what this article meant. My apologies - this is not the page annotation that will be helpful for those looking to glean insights!
