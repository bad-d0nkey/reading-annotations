# 7. Show Your Work
URL: https://data-feminism.mitpress.mit.edu/pub/0vgzaln4/release/3

Intersectionality is tossed around a lot. I read a funny article about all the (sickeningly ironic) takes on what it "means", those meanings seeming to depend on what the organisation extolling the term needs it to do for its image. I had never thought to apply the theory along with labour theories to the digital.

Does any of your work relate to this area? I'd love to hear about what folks are doing, if so.

I'm wondering what a living archive of the sorts of stories the people this chapter discusses could look like...

connected ideas:  ;I had not heard of this until now. How in dog's name did Amazon think this was a good name? 

Maybe I have disciplinary blinders on. Or maybe it's because I'm looking backward from a place where we know how Amazon values labour (multiple meanings intended). Still - as someone hailing from critical technology studies, I can't imagine that [this name](https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/2016/07/11/what-is-mechanical-turk/) for the scenario would ever not have been jarring.

Is anyone else gobsmacked by this name? And may I ask why/why not?

What would a scenario where people got credit for this in academic work look like, I wonder?

I'd love to see what that actually looks like. Literally looks - what if someone could take the shipping visualisation idea as a starting point for a data-related project (content moderation, for example) and actually fill it in with "their" work.

connected ideas:  ;I think that would be pretty cool. Alas, I think that might fall prey to the same thing this chapter mentions about Turkopticon - that people eventually get burned out. Our system doesn't seem to value that sort of work to support it. 

Not that that's a reason not to try, of course! [Kim Martin](https://www.kim-martin.ca/), who shows up in our [readings](https://muse-jhu-edu.proxy.library.carleton.ca/article/777494), and [Susan Brown](https://www.uoguelph.ca/~sbrown/#projects) have [wikipedia edit-a-thons](https://www.uoguelph.ca/arts/dhguelph/programming) that are worth checking out! They're more about LOD, but content features, too.
