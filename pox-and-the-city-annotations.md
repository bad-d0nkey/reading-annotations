# Pox and the City (Zucconi, Watrall, Ueno, & Rosner) | Writing History in the Digital Age
URL: https://writinghistory.trincoll.edu/evidence/zucconi-etal-2012-spring/

This is beautiful. I'm also taking HIST5003 and the readings for the first week centred around this theme. 

If anyone has any of those "aha!" resources related to collaborative/story-telling history, I would love some suggestions. I would also love to hear about any experiences with this sort of approach y'all may have.

connected ideas:  ;I worked on a project at work in which the goal was for people to experience making the decisions historically made for an event. Interestingly, half the people "fixed the problem" by doing things like mentioned here (*i.e.*, navigating Italy toward staving off WWI). Some people just wouldn't play the game, so to speak. I have no idea how to study that, but it's bounced around in my head for years.

connected ideas:  ;But why is it out of the question? We learn through experience and we learn through mistakes. Imagine if we could experience historical mistakes of other people and have to sit with those feelings. I feel like there's potential there.

I understand the practicalities of this statement, but... I wonder if this could be designed as a tool to make people understand one another better. 

There is an interesting [project by Dan Carlin](https://www.theworldwar.org/war-remains) that is somewhat controversial. Most people last about 5 minutes max. Many come out messed up and/or crying. Most everyone interviewed after reported empathy with people who actually had to live this. Why is this different?

connected ideas:  ;This point is fascinating to me. The beauty of a game is its affordances. History can be read in books. But when you can add interactive storytelling/agency, history can be "experienced". To convey experience, one must introduce the human element. And the human element is not historical - it continues within us today. It's what makes us people, regardless of era. Procedural rhetoric affords some interesting opportunities to instill empathy with the past. I will admit that, at first, the last line of the preceding paragraph was all I had considered when anticipating how they would approach the design. Use facts and make a narrative. Well... maybe not. What underlies that assumption? And why? 

(Ian Bogost has a great [article on procedural rhetoric](https://firstmonday.org/article/view/1617/1532) and having to make decisions about game design)

connected ideas:  ;This reading outlines design considerations an interdisciplinary team had to make regarding the creation of a game, *Pox and the City*. The game will allow players to experience a historical event - living during the time of smallpox and the development of the vaccine for it - from multiple perspectives. 

The authors set out their rationale as they made design choices - a perspective we often are not privy to as end-users of a game. By questioning the purpose of the game - the underlying pedagogy - the designers were able to arrive at a design that not only preserved the integrity of the event (which can be skewed by user decision trees), but also presented multiple perspectives through which the event could be experienced, thereby enabling user immersion/user empathy that ultimately better underscored the pedagogical goals.
